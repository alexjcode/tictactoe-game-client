# Tic Tac Toe Project

## Technologies Used
- Atom
- Git
- GitHub
- SASS
- Node Dependencies
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- tic-tac-toe-wdi API
- Photoshop

## Planning
First I created the sign in functionality, and the game winning logic. I didn't touch the win logic until later.
I used a numbered tag on each clickable div, allowing me to tie each div to an index that could be sent to the api.

## Unsolved problems
- Add a win / lose / draw popup in the future
- The win counter is occasionally buggy, although it could just be slow internet. I would like to investigate other methods of verifying outcome
- CSS overhaul. Bootstrap and Flex are tricky
- Online Multiplayer

## Version control
I commited about once for every hour of work. Using git, i worked on a brach of the main repository, and merged to the main after adding features with working code, in order to separate the testing code from the main code.
