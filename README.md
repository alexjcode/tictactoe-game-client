## Planning
First I created the sign in functionality, and the game winning logic. I didn't touch the win logic until later.
I used a numbered tag on each clickable div, allowing me to tie each div to an index that could be sent to the api.

This will be the base of the game logic, and then I will need to set up events for checking a box, authenticating login actions, and when a player wins the game.

## Game Board in JS
I will represent the game board in JS as an array of objects, with different states (unchecked, X, and O)

## Plan of Approach


## User stories
As a player with a friend nearby, I want to be able to play this game with them and keep score.
As a player by myself, I want to be able to play this game online.
As a player by myself, I want to be able to play this game in single player mode.
As an impatient player, I want the page to load within 3 seconds, so that I dont leave the website.
As an artsy player, I want the game to have intuitive UI and not use Comic Sans or Papyrus.

## Keeping my code modular
I will split my css up according to themes and colors. I'll be splitting my JS code up according to events, the main app file, the api requests, and in general, i will add more files on if the code is getting redundant.

## Creative spin
I'm going to try out a bunch of different css "themes", and maybe try using faces instead of X or O. I would also like to use different light up effects or windows that pop up when a player wins

## Version control
I will be commiting at least once for every hour of work. Using git, i'll be working on a brach of the main repository, and the merging to the main after features are added, and the code is working, in order to separate the testing code from the working code.

## Extra features
If i have extra time, I'll look at adding online multiplayer, and perhaps a save file of some sort. I can always add more css and effects
